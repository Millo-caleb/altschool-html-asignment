            <article>
              <p>My name is Latifat Adisa, I'm currently enrolled as a Cloud engineering student at AltSchool Africa and my student ID is: ALT/SOE/025/3663. I am a very curious and driven individual with a growing passion for technology and its potential to solve real-world problems.</p>
              <p>I come from a non-technical background, but I have always been fascinated by how digital systems work, especially in Cloud computing.</p>

            <article>
              <p>Making the big switch into tech has been a journey filled with curiosity, resilience, and a fair share of trial and error. As a self-taught learner with no prior understanding of the tech ecosysytem, I have had to explore multiple fields ranging from Backend and Frontend development to dabbling into Cybersecurity courses on Udemy.</p>
              <p>Through this process, I discovered Cloud computing, both as a concept and a career path. The concept of reimagined access, the idea of being able to <strong>scale, deploy, and manage systems remotely</strong> resonated deeply with me. But I quickly realized that passion alone wasn't enough;I needed structure, community,and a clearly defined path.</p>
              <p>I joined this program at AltSchool beacuse it offers the structured learning environment I have been seeking, one that would help me commit fully to my career goals and also equip me with the skills needed to thrive in the tech ecosystem.</p>

            <h2 title="my goals for school of engineering"><em>What exactly are my goals for the S.O.E?...</em></h2>
            <article>
              <P>My goal is to become a well-rounded cloud engineer who can contribute to building scalable, secure, and efficient systems. I want to master cloud infrastructures, improve my problem-solving skills, and gain real-world experience through hands-on projects.</P>
              <p>Beyond technical mastery, I'm deeply committed to contributing to the future of Altschool and the School of Enginnering. I want to be part of its robust alumni network, not just as a graduate but as a bridge. I hope to foster growth in the community and also create opportunities for others.</p>
              <p>In the long term, I'd love to create scholarship programs, mentor future students, and advocate for access to quality tech education across communities. By actively giving back, I want my journey to inspire and empower others to become everything they've hoped to be.</p>
