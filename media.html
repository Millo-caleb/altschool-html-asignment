            <p>Like the Ivy plant pushing through cracks, I've grown through unexpected spaces. This image reflects not only my path in tech, it's a reminder of why I have pushed this far, of everything that counts. And maybe someday, we'll live beyond survival and truly blossom.</p>

            <p>In my own voice, I share a piece of my journey. I have spoken briefly about my interests and aspirations_<em>it's actually nice that I get to document stuff this wayâ˜º</em></p>

            <p>Every inch of growth sure takes time. I've recently stumbled on a Japanese word called <strong>Oubaitori</strong>_ <em><strong>It's the idea that people bloom in their own time and in their own ways just like flowers.</strong></em> This flower blooming in stillness is a mirror of my evolution_ that's what I'd like to think.</p>

            <p>I remember coming across this guide on Twitter(X), and it was so good I printed it and included it in my vision board. Through this guide, I was able to explore Cloud concepts and build on my interests, so I think it's worth a mention in my journey.</p>
